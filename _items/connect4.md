My connect four website is currently online as a public beta. You can visit the
website at <https://connect4.pipeframe.xyz>. A list of known bugs is on the
homepage, and all other issues should be submitted to
[GitHub](https://github.com/lonkaars/connect-4/issues).

If I encounter some very interesing bug that I think deserves it's own blog
post I'll write one about it of course. I have one more week from now to worry
about the connect four website, but after that I'm going to start preparing for
my school exams.
