title: Loek's excruciatingly interesting blog
---

Welcome to my blog page! This is where I post updates on things that I do such
as:

- Cool open source software that I think you should use
- How to set up self-hosted applications
- Rants about Microsoft Windows
- Maybe some recipes I dunno

The page you're looking at right now is also open-source! The code for this
page can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lonkaars/blog), and should
also be available on [my private git server](https://git.pipeframe.xyz).
